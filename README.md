INTRODUCTION
------------
In this project, two classifiers were created. The first classifier was a K-NN classifier and the second one was a simple Perceptron.
Both were created from scratch and both used two different datasets.
The first dataset was the a4a dataset, which is a binary outcome dataset that can have an outcome of either +1 or -1.
The other was the famous multiclass Iris dataset which can have an outcome of 1, 2, or 3.


Usage
